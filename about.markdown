# ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to a small blog. This is **Kisoo Kim**, a small mathematics student at somewhere.
I use English and Japanese in reading or writing.

**cwlo2F** is one of my favorite sequences. I like this name, while I do not know how to pronounce it.

# (Hobby level) Interests
I am generally interested in mathematics and computer science.
However, I usually feel that those are too wide and I do not concentrate on them well.
The followings are my interests as an undergraduate student, and I do not have research level knowledge...

## Mathematics
I am interested in algebraic things, especially number theory.

## Computer Science
Computers are awesome.
I had solved algorithm problems, but not active currently.

I am learning and using [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Others
`todo!()`
